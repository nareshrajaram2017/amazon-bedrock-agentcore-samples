# Adding GenAI Observability and Bedrock Guardrails to Your Customer Support Agent

## Overview

In this lab, you will **enhance your existing Lab 1 agent** with AgentCore Observability and Bedrock Guardrails capabilities.

We will focus on adding observability and guardrails to a Strands Agents with Amazon Bedrock model example.

### Tutorial Architecture

In this tutorial we will enhance an existing customer support agent with observability and guardrails capabilities.

For demonstration purposes, we will use a Strands Agent using Amazon Bedrock models with:
- **Amazon Bedrock Guardrails** for content filtering and topic restrictions
- **AgentCore Observability** using Amazon OpenTelemetry Python Instrumentation
- **Amazon CloudWatch GenAI Observability** for trace visualization

In our example we will use a customer support agent with four tools: `get_order_status`, `get_product_info`, `get_shipping_info`, and `get_return_policy`.
