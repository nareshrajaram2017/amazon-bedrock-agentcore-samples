    "# Lab 5: Adding GenAI Observability and Bedrock Guardrails to Your Customer Support Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will **enhance your existing Lab 1 agent** with AgentCore Observability and Bedrock Guardrails capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Add\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Amazon Bedrock Guardrails**\n",
    "- **Enable you to implement safeguards** using multiple guardrails with Strands Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **AgentCore Observability Features**:\n",
    "- **Set up** Amazon OpenTelemetry Python Instrumentation  \n",
    "- **Visualize and analyze** agent traces in Amazon CloudWatch GenAI Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Details\n",
    "\n",
    "| Information | Details |\n",
    "|-------------|---------|\n",
    "| **Tutorial type** | Incremental Enhancement |\n",
    "| **Agent type** | Single Agent |\n",

    "| **Tutorial vertical** | Customer Support |\n",
    "| **Complexity** | Easy to Moderate |\n",
    "| **SDK used** | Strands SDK, AgentCore Observability, Cloudwatch, Bedrock, boto3 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Must complete Lab 1 first** - This lab builds directly on your Lab 1 agent \n",
    "- ✅ **Enable transaction search on Amazon CloudWatch** - First-time users must enable CloudWatch Transaction Search to view Bedrock AgentCore spans and traces. To enable transaction search, please refer to the our [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Enable-TransactionSearch.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "- Use the official Amazon CloudWatch GenAI Observability Dashboard\n",
    "- Call Strands Agents with Bedrock Guardrails applied\n",
